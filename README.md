## 🚀 **Overview**

**Color Wars** is a two-player strategic Android game where players engage in a battle of colors to dominate a 5x5 grid. Designed with intelligent AI that adapts its strategy based on the selected difficulty level, this game challenges players to think critically and strategically to outmaneuver their opponents.

### 🔥 **Key Features**
- **Three AI Difficulty Levels**: 
  - **Easy**: Fuzzy Logic for basic decision-making.
  - **Medium**: Genetic Algorithms for evolving strategies.
  - **Hard**: Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimal moves.
- **Turn-Based Strategy**: Engage in a thoughtful and tactical gameplay experience.
- **Chain Reactions**: Trigger cascading events that can change the course of the game.

## 🎮 **How to Play**
1. **Choose Your Difficulty**: Start by selecting a difficulty level—Easy, Medium, or Hard.
2. **Place Your Circle**: Click on any square on the 5x5 grid to place your first red circle.
3. **Increase Circle Value**: Click on your circles to add dots, increasing their value up to 4.
4. **Spread and Conquer**: Once a circle reaches 4 dots, it spreads to adjacent squares, capturing opponent circles.
5. **Win the Game**: Dominate the entire grid or eliminate your opponent’s circles to win.

## 🧠 **AI Implementation**

### 🤖 **Fuzzy Logic (Easy Mode)**
Simulates human-like decision-making by considering degrees of truth rather than binary logic. Ideal for beginners.

### 🧬 **Genetic Algorithm (Medium Mode)**
Inspired by natural selection, this AI evolves its strategy over multiple generations, offering a dynamic and adaptive challenge.

### 🔍 **Alpha-Beta Pruning (Hard Mode)**
Optimizes decision-making by pruning irrelevant branches in the decision tree, ensuring the AI makes the most strategic moves.

## 📚 **Educational Value**

**Color Wars** isn’t just a game—it's a learning platform. By playing, users gain insights into:
- Strategic Thinking and Problem-Solving
- AI Algorithms in Action: Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms, Alpha-Beta Pruning
